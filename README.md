# Pafish
## (Paranoid Fish)

Pafish is a demo tool that performs some anti(debugger/VM/sandbox) tricks. Most of them are often used by malware to avoid debugging and dynamic analysis.

The project is open source, you can read the code of all anti-analysis checks. You can also [download](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish/raw/master/pafish.exe) the compiled executable (or compile it by yourself) and reverse engineer it, which is quite recommended.

It is licensed under GNU/GPL version 3.

# Scope

Note that the aim of the project is not to implement complex VM detections.

The objective of this project is to collect usual tricks seen in malware samples. This allows us to study it, and test if our analysis environments are properly implemented.

Examples of execution (v025 all of them):

[ThreatExpert](http://www.threatexpert.com/report.aspx?md5=7662cb4b1abc4ccb30b3682acc3dae24)  
[Cuckoo Sandbox](https://malwr.com/analysis/NTI1YjgyM2IxNzk3NDI3YjkyYzNkN2Y3NGE1NWFmZjE/)

# Certificate

All releases from v024 will be shipped signed by the original development team. Consider everything without our certificate as unofficial, you can check it against the certificates present in the binaries from this repository.

# DLL

Some software projects may be interested in use some of the functions pafish brings. To make it possible, [pafish-dll](https://github.com/a0rtega/pafish-dll) is a side project to maintain a DLL with all the features present on pafish.

# Additional software

The DMI tests require dmidecode.exe in the same directory as pafish.exe. Dmidecode for windows can be obtained here: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/dmidecode.htm

# Build

Pafish is written in C and developed with [wxDev-C++](http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/).
